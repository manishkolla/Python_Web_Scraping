# Python_Web_Scraping
Retrieving data from  various websites and exporting into a excel/csv file
Web Scraping: "Web scraping is the process of using bots to extract content and data from a website. 
Unlike screen scraping, which only copies pixels displayed onscreen, web scraping extracts underlying HTML code and, with it, data stored in a database."

This repository includes all the websites I have worked on to scrape the data using python libraries like BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Requests, and Pandas
Using SQL and MariaDB to store all the retreived data in a database.
Websites inlcude:
1. Georgia State University webpages
